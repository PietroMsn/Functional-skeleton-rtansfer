## Quick-start  
  To run the project you have to run the file:
  ```
  main.py
  ```
  which runs the code using the meshes in the directory:
  ```
  data/
  ```
  In the given example the basic SMPL model is the Source and a remeshed mesh of Dynamic FAUST is the target.
  
  You can find the sample data here:
  * SMPL model: http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de
  * Dynamic FAUST dataset: https://dfaust.is.tue.mpg.de/
  
  
## Requirements
  This code is tested over Windows 10 64bit, and Python 3.7 (other versions of Python 3 should run according with required versions of packages). All necessary files are already conteined inside this repository.
  
  All the required packages are listed in the file:
  ```
  requirements.txt
  ```
